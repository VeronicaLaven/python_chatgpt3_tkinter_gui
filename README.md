<img src="images/chat_ice_cream.png" alt="Screenshot of Chatbot GUI]" width="300" height="340">

### Intro
Bring the functionality of ChatGPT3 to your desktop with this app that uses an OpenAI API key and the davinci model that allows the user to to enter prompts and have response display in a TKinter constructed GUI.

The code uses the OpenAI API to generate responses to user prompts, and inserts the prompts and responses into separate text boxes to keep track of the conversation history.

### Description
This app contains:
1. Prompt entry box to input user prompt
2. Send button to submit user prompt
3. Mapping of send button to keyboard 'Return' or 'Enter' key
4. Box to log and display prompts entered
5. Response box to display ChatGPT3 response
6. Clear button to clear text from each of the boxes
7. Copy button to copy response text to the clipboard
8. Quit button to exit app
9. Scroll bars for prompt log and response boxes


### Steps
1. Create an Account to obtain an API Key at:

   https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
2. Create a config.ini file in which to store secret API key to be accessed by program 
3. Use ConfigParser module to extract API key from config.ini
4. Select GPT-3.5 Model
5. Set up TKinter window
6. Set up text entry box for prompt
7. Set up Send button to submit prompt
8. Set up Response box
9. Set up prompt log box to display prompts entered
10. Set up horizontal scroll bar to view entirety of prompt
11. Set up clear button to clear contents of all text boxes
12. Set up a vertical scroll bar to view entirety of response
13. Map keyboard 'Return' key to Send button
14. Set up copy button to copy response contents to clipboard
15. Set up Quit Button to exit 
16. Finalize TKinter GUI



ChatGPT-3 is a conversational chatbot built using OpenAI's GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) language model. GPT-3 has been trained on vast amounts of text data to generate human-like responses to natural language inputs. 

The gpt3_model variable in the code is set to the name of the GPT-3 engine being used, which in this case is "text-davinci-003".

For example, "text-davinci-003" is one of the largest GPT-3 models with 175 billion parameters, while "curie" has 6.7 billion parameters, and "babbage" has 1.5 billion parameters.

Here, parameters refer to the number of learnable weights that can be adjusted during the model's training process. A model with more parameters can learn more complex patterns and relationships in the data which can improve its performance on various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This means that the model can generate more accurate and natural-sounding language.

This is a code snippet that defines a function response, which is used to generate responses from an OpenAI GPT-3 language model based on user input. 

```
def response(event=None):
    entry_prompt = prompt_box.get()
    # insert question / prompt user enters
    prompt_log_box.insert(0, "Prompt Log : " + entry_prompt)
    answer = openai.Completion.create(
        engine=gpt3_model,
        prompt=entry_prompt,
        max_tokens = 2000,
        stop = None,
    )
    message = answer.choices[0].text
    response_box.configure(wrap=WORD)
    response_box.insert(END, "chatbot : " + message + " \n")

```

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the code snippet:

entry_prompt = prompt_box.get() : This line retrieves the text entered by the user in the prompt_box input widget and assigns it to the entry_prompt variable. The user's text input is the prompt or question that will be used to generate the chatbot's response.

prompt_log_box.insert(0, "Prompt Log : " + entry_prompt) : This line inserts the user's input or prompt into a text box named prompt_log_box to keep a log of the user's prompt history.

answer = openai.Completion.create( : This line sends the user's prompt to the OpenAI API and retrieves a response from the GPT-3 language model. The response is assigned to the answer variable.

engine=gpt3_model, : This line specifies which GPT-3 language model to use. The variable gpt3_model holds the ID of the GPT-3 model to use, which was obtained when the model was created.

prompt=entry_prompt, : This line specifies the user's prompt as the starting point for the GPT-3 language model to generate a response.

max_tokens = 2000, : This line sets the maximum number of tokens (i.e., words or subwords) that the GPT-3 language model is allowed to generate in response to the prompt. The maximum number of tokens is set to 2000.

stop = None, : This line specifies that the GPT-3 language model should generate a response without any specific stopping criteria. In other words, the model should generate as much text as allowed by the max_tokens parameter.

message = answer.choices[0].text : This line retrieves the text generated by the GPT-3 language model in response to the user's prompt. The choices attribute of the answer object contains a list of possible responses, and the first item in the list is selected and its text attribute is assigned to the message variable.

response_box.configure(wrap=WORD) : This line sets the wrap mode of the response_box text widget to WORD. This confines the text to the boundaries of the text container width thereby avoiding the  need for a horizontal scroll.

response_box.insert(END, "chatbot : " + message + " \n") : This line inserts the generated text into a response_box widget with a label "chatbot". The END parameter specifies that the text should be inserted at the end of the widget, and the "\n" character adds a new line after the message is inserted.
